# Celebrity Detection with AI

Made by Molten Cores (●*∩_∩*●)


During our time in AI Camp, we learned a lot of things. We learned a lot of things during this camp such as the basics of python, ai topics such as CNN, neural networks, interperting graphs/data, neurons and designing a website using html, css, bootstrap and flask. By the end of the three weeks we created our own website with our Celebrity Detection with AI on it.
